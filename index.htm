<h1>I make YOU a site</h1>
<p>This is a service where you can get a site like this, or with images for links. It would cost 5 bucks and I will find a way to host it for you. It can have a total of three pages. You send me the images for buttons and videos and music and the stuff you want on the site and how the site is structured, like with a drawing or something. And I make it. Got nothing else to do. If you want a website email me at <address>jkstanw09@gmail.com</address></p>
